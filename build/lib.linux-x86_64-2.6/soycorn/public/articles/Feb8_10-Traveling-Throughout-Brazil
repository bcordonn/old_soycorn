Traveling Throughout Brazil
<p>
We will be traveling throughout Brazil for much of the month of February and it will be difficult to update the web site with two new stories every day.  Please bear with me and I will post new stories whenever it is possible.  We are currently in Rondonopolis, Mato Grosso and most of this week will be dedicated to seeing the soybean crop in this enormous state.  The last few days have been dryer and farmers are taking advantage in the break in the rains to accelerate their soybean harvest.
