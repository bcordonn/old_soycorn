Merger Of Sadia And Perdigao Creates Brazilian Powerhouse
	  <p>
	    Sadia and Perdigao, two of Brazil’s largest and best known food companies, announced a merger plan that would create one of the world’s largest exporters of poultry and processed meats.  The combined company is to be called Brazil Foods SA.  This is another indication that Brazil is destined to be a powerhouse in livestock production and exporting.  Brazil has come onto the scene sort of under the radar because they export much of their livestock products to countries where we do not do much business such as the Middle East, Eastern Europe, and Russia.  In the U.S., our trade policy and foreign policy are intertwined, whereas in Brazil, foreign policy does not come into play when deciding whom they should trade with.  They have no qualms selling their products to countries that we distain.

	    The merger was precipitated by Sadia’s huge losses in 2008 in the currency markets as well as losses connected with credit default swaps.
