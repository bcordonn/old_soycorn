Heavy Rains Delay Rice Planting In Rio Grande do Sul
<p>
The state of Rio Grande do Sul is the major rice producing state in Brazil accounting for 62% of the national production, but heavy rains over the last few weeks have delayed rice planting in the state, which could result in reduced yields.  Approximately 66% of the intended rice acreage in the state has been planted, but the optimum planting window for medium maturing rice varieties has already passed.

Rice producers in the state choose different length maturities of rice varieties depending on when the rice is planted.  Long maturity varieties are planted before November 1st.  If planting occurs between November 1-15, medium maturity varieties are used.  If the planting is delayed until November 15-30, short maturity varieties are used.  The highest yield potential is generally achieved from the longer maturities and the lowest yields from the shorter maturities.  The one third of the rice that still needs to be planted will have to be short maturity varieties and thus lower yielding.

Farmers in Rio Grande do Sul plant approximately 40% of the rice acreage in Brazil, but they produce approximately 60% of the rice in Brazil.  Only irrigated rice is grown in the state, which is what accounts for the high productivity of rice production.  Conab estimated that 1.1 million hectares of rice would be planted in Rio Grande do Sul in 2009-10, but 350,000 hectares of rice are still not planted and if the planting conditions don't improve by the end of the month, as much as 100,000 hectares may not be planted to rice at all.  Some of the rice already planted will also have to be replanted once conditions improve.

In its November Report, Conab had already anticipated a yield reduction of 400 kg/ha in the state (6,750 kg/ha in 2009-10 vs. 7,150 kg/ha in 2008-09) with many people now anticipating yield losses in excess of 500 kg/ha.  Brazil's total rice crop in 2009-10 is expected to be 12.1 million tons with a domestic demand of 12.8 million tons.  Rice stocks are expected to decline next year to just 758,000 tons or 5.8% of consumption.
