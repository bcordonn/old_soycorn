Brazilian Scientists Propose The Use Of Degraded Pastures For Soybean Expansion
<p>
 For several years Brazilian scientist have been promoting the idea that future soybean expansion should be into areas of what's called degraded pastures instead of virgin land.  These areas may have been in pasture for many decades, but the land is relatively infertile and the carrying capacity is quite low, on the order of one cow per hectare (two and a half acres).  The scientists feel this method of expansion offers several advantages over the clearing of new land.  The most obvious advantage is that these areas do not need to be deforested.  Reducing deforestation is very important to Brazil at a time when the world is concerned about preserving the remaining rainforest.  Secondly, if the land is eventually returned to pasture in the future, it is higher in fertility and has a greater carrying capacity than before it was converted to row crop production.

Degraded pastures are generally quite low in fertility and substantial amounts of agricultural limestone and fertilizers need to be applied to achieve profitable soybean production. The total cost of converting a hectare of degraded pasture into soybean production is estimated to be R$ 580 per hectare.   These cost include R$ 275 for five tons of agricultural limestone, R$ 115 for equipment usage, and R$ 100 for final land preparation.  Additionally, Brazilian ranchers usually leave occasional trees standing in the pastures to provide shade for the cattle; so these trees and their stumps must be removed at a cost of R$ 80 per hectare before row crops can be grown.  Once the land is prepared, then there is the additional cost of actually planting the soybeans.

Soybean production costs are lower in Brazil this year compared to last year due to the drop in fertilizer prices.  In the state of Tocantins in east central Brazil, the cost of producing a hectare of soybeans that yields 50 sacks of soybeans (60 kilograms per sack or 3,000 kilograms per hectare) is estimated at R$ 1,200, which is up to R$ 600 cheaper than in 2008-09.
