Hopeful Rains In Central Brazil, Heavy Rains In Southern Brazil
<p>
The soybean farmers in central Brazil, including Mato Grosso, were pleasantly surprised last week when significant rainfall helped to partially replenish their parched soils.  This is the second rain system that has moved across the region in the last three weeks.  This is early for rainfall in Mato Grosso, and in fact, its probably been 20 years since the rains have occurred this early in the growing season in central Brazil.  A word of caution though, one or two good rains does not necessarily mean that the rainy season has started.  It is not uncommon for a few rains to fall and then for the weather to turn dry for several more weeks.  That is why farmers are very cautious about planting their crops after the first one or two rains.  If they plant too early, the seeds germinate, but then they subsequently wither when the weather turns dry.  This is also the hottest time of the year in central Brazil.  In Rondonopolis, Mato Grosso for example, the forecast is calling for temperatures to be over 100 degrees for the next ten days.  With those types of temperatures and intense sunshine, it doesn't take long for the soil to dry out.

The rainfall in southern Brazil has been much heavier.  In Sao Paulo, Parana, and Rio Grande do Sul the rains have been intense and there has been localized flooding.  Farmers are trying to plant their corn in southern Brazil, but the heavy rains have kept the planting pace slower than normal.  In Rio Grande do Sul for example, the corn is 20% planted, which is about 11% slower than the five-year average.
