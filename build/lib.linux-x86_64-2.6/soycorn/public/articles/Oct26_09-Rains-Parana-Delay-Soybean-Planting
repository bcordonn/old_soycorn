Rains In Parana Delaying Soybean Planting
<p>
Heavy rains continue to fall in southern Brazil especially in the state of Parana where farmers are struggling to plant their 2009-10 full-season corn and soybean crops.  Statewide, approximately 20% of the soybean crop has been planted, but planting progress varies widely by region.  According to the Department of Rural Economics (<i>Departmento de Economia Rural - DERAL</i>) the most advanced planting pace is in western Parana (in the area of Cascavel and Toledo) where 40-50% of the crop has been planted followed by the center-west region (Campo Mourao) with 15% planted.  Soybean planting in the northern part of the state (Maringa) is the slowest with just 5% planted.  Of the crop that has been planted approximately 50% is germinating, 35% is in vegetative development and 17% has started to flower.  The soybean crop in the state is rated as 85% good and 15% average.

Delayed soybean planting in Parana does not necessarily mean lower potential yields for the crop.  Soybeans can be planted in Parana until the end of November without any reduction in yield potential.  In recent years though, farmers in Parana have been planting their soybeans earlier in order to allow time to plant a second crop of corn (<i>safrinha</i> corn) after the soybeans are harvested.  During the decade of the 1990s, generally about 20% of Parana's soybeans were planted by the end of October.  Today, approximately 40-50% of the soybeans are planted by the end of October.

 The <i>safrinha</i> corn crop is planted primarily in northern Parana where the rainfall has been the heaviest and the soybean planting has been the slowest.  Further delays in soybean planting in northern Parana will result in the <i>safrinha</i> corn crop being planted late as well.  If the <i>safrinha</i> corn crop is planted too late (February or March), it runs the risk of encountering cold weather during the grain filling period and subsequently lower yields.  Planting a <i>safrinha</i> corn crop is always a risky proposition, which is why farmers in Parana limit the amount of inputs for the crop.  If it is planted later than normal, the risk of lower yields goes even higher.
