Mato Grosso Soybeans Already 15% Planted 
<p>
Farmers in Mato Grosso have already planted at least 15% of their intended soybean acreage.  According to the Mato Grosso Agricultural Economic Institute (<i>Instituto Mato-grossense de Economia Agropecuaria - Imea</i>), this is one of the fastest starts in recent years.  The two municipalities where the planting pace is most advanced are Lucas do Rio Verde in the north-central Mato Grosso where 30% of the soybeans have been planted and Sapezal in northwestern Mato Grosso where 25% has been planted.  Lucas do Rio Verde is famous in Brazil for being the location where the first soybeans are almost always planted.  This is also the municipality where majority of the soybeans are followed by a second crop of <i>safrinha</i> corn.

<p>This has been a very early start for the rainy season in Central Brazil.  For the last two years, the rains did not pick up until mid-October, but this year, the rains started in early September and they have been building ever since.  Soybean planting is underway in all parts of Mato Grosso and since the soybeans have been planted early, the harvest should start early as well.  I would not be surprised at all if farmers in north-central Mato Grosso start to harvest their soybeans by early January.  The early harvest should also lead to early exports out of Brazil, which might start by the end of January.</p>
