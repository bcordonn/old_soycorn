Environmental Concerns Worry Farmers In Mato Grosso
	  <p>
	    The Brazilian government announced that there would be an increase of 37% in the amount of money available for production loans for the 2009-10 growing season.  This is certainly good news for many Brazilian farmers, but it is unclear if it will actually help many soybean farmers in Mato Grosso.  An ever-increasing concern in Mato Grosso is tightening environmental regulations concerning deforestation in the Amazon Region.

	    If a farmer’s property lies within the boundaries of what is considered the Lowland Amazon Region, they must obtain an Environmental License issued by the government before they can become eligible for credit programs offered by the federal government.  This license verifies that the farmer is conducting his farming operation within the guidelines of the current environmental laws.  The problem is that very few farmers in the Lowland Amazon Region have such a license.  Obtaining such a license is very complicated because the environmental laws have changed since the land was purchased.

	    They can’t go backwards and undo what they did, but they can’t go forward because they are in violation of the law.  The solution if course is to grandfather them into the new regulations and that is what the government is trying to do.  This effort is being complicated by environmental groups such as Greenpeace that are fighting against such a grandfather clause.

	    Another problem for Mato Grosso farmers is the fact that the definition of what is exactly the Lowland Amazon Region is yet to be clarified.  The state of Mato Grosso has three distinct zones, the cerrado, a transition between cerrado and the Amazon Forest, and then the Lowland Amazon Region.  The main conflict arises in the transition zone.  Much of the transition vegetation has already been cleared for agricultural production and the farmers claim that they should not be subject to the tougher regulations that apply to the Lowland Amazon Region.  The environmental groups claim that the transition region is also very important and it should be subjected to the same tough regulations as the Lowland Amazon Region.
