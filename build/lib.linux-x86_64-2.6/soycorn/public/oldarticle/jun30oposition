Opposition Soundly Defeats Ruling Party In Argentine Elections
	  <p>
	    Mid-term congressional elections were held in Argentina on Sunday and the ruling Peronist party lost control of both the upper and lower houses of Congress.  It was a resounding defeat for President Kirchner and an even bigger embarrassment for her husband, the former president, who lost his bid for a seat in the lower chamber.  Some are calling for her to step down and call early presidential elections, but that is only a remote possibility.  The opposition parties (and there are many) are calling on the president to come to the negotiation table to rethink some of her more contentious policies.

	    These elections were originally scheduled to be held in October, so the newly elected members of Congress won’t take office until early December, so there is going to be a six-month period where probably very little will be accomplished in Congress. The opposition in Congress will now be more emboldened to act as a check if President Kirchner decided on further nationalizations such as she did with pension funds and the largest airline in the country.

	    This is the outcome that many farm organizations has hoped for, in fact, a coalition of farm organization managed to get 11 members elected to the lower house.  The farmers are now hopeful that something will be done to lower the export taxes on agricultural commodities, which was imposed by the Kirchner regime.  There is now little probability that these export taxes will increase, but it is as yet unclear if the opposition will be able to muster enough support in Congress to actually lower some of these taxes.  Certainly the farmers in Argentina view this as a victory for their cause in the long run, but I don’t know if it is going to help very much a few months from now when they go to the field to plant their 2009-10 crops.
