Canola Gaining Foothold as a Safrinha Crop in Brazil
<p>
	Farmers in Brazil are now viewing canola as a viable alternative to corn as a <i>safrinha</i> crop.  Five years ago, the production of canola in Brazil was practically zero.  Today there is approximately 40,000 hectares of canola grown in Brazil and it is increasing rapidly every year.  The largest producing state is Rio Grande do Sul (slightly more than 50% of Brazil's total) followed by Parana (approximately one third of the total) and the crop is even gaining popularity in central Brazil.

	Canola oil is currently being used in food products in Brazil, but it is also being promoted as an alternative vegetable oil in the production of biodiesel.  In the state of Parana, farmers planted 12,800 hectares of canola in 2010 (double last year's acreage) and they are expecting a record yield of 1,670 kg/ha compared to 1,160 kg/ha recorded last year.  Yields were lower than expected last year due to the heavy rains which delayed the harvest and resulted in yield losses.

	Brazilian farmers and scientists are still feeling their way when it comes to canola production.  Canola is usually considered a crop for cooler climates so in Brazil, it is planted after the soybeans are harvested and it matures during the coolest time of the year.  All the varieties planted in Brazil are imported from Canada.  Brazilian scientists are developing varieties more suited for Brazil's growing conditions, but for the near term, only Canadian varieties are being grown.

	Agronomists feel that canola offers a good alternative to <i>safrinha</i> corn production.  It provides a different type of rotation which is always a good agronomic practice.  It produces more oil per hectare than soybeans and at a lower cost.  Additionally, there is a high demand for the oil by food manufactures and the biodiesel industry.

	The Brazilian government has been heavily promoting the idea of using alternative vegetable oils for the production of biodiesel.  Currently, 80% of the raw material for the production of biodiesel is soybean oil.  Canola oil is one of the alternatives being promoted as well as palm oil, castor bean oil and nut oil.
