Brazil's Safrinha Corn Suffering from Hot and Dry Conditions
<p>
The second crop of corn in Brazil, called the <i>safrinha</i>, is produced primarily in the states of Mato Grosso and Parana.  The <i>safrinha</i> corn crop is planted immediately after the first crop of soybeans is harvested and it has been growing larger and larger in recent years now accounting for nearly 40% of Brazil's total corn production.  Brazilian farmers are opting for more <i>safrinha</i> corn production because it allows them to harvest two crops from the same field in one growing season.  The condition of the corn crop in the two principal production regions is very different.  In Mato Grosso the yield prospects are declining under hot and dry conditions, while in Parana, frequent rains have allowed the crop to develop normally.

In much of Mato Grosso it's been more than three weeks with little or no rainfall.  At the same time, the daytime temperatures have been in the mid 90's and the nighttime temperatures have been very warm as well.  The soils in Mato Grosso do not have a very high water holding capacity and the high evapotranspiration rate has led to very short soil moisture.

<p>
Much of the corn in the state is at a very sensitive phase in its development with 35% of the crop pollinating and 22% of the crop filling grain.  The earlier planted corn is far enough along in its development to avoid any major yield reductions, but the later planted corn is at risk of very severe damage if rains do not materialize quickly.  Unfortunately, the forecast holds out little hope for rainfall during the next two weeks.

<p>
Mato Grosso farmers planted nearly 2 million hectares of <i>safrinha</i> corn in 2010 (40% of Brazil's total), which was an increase of 25% compared to 2009.

The condition of the <i>safrinha</i> corn in Parana is very different.  Frequent rainfall has kept the soil moisture level at 80% of capacity.  Recent storms brought high winds that damaged some of the corn in isolated regions of the state, but the overall condition of the crop remains good to very good.  Approximately 12% of the crop in Parana is pollinating and 8% is filling grain.  The forecast is calling for isolated rain over the next two weeks which should allow the crop to continue developing normally.
</p>
<p>
Parana farmers planted 1.3 million hectares of <i>safrinha</i> corn in 2010 (27% of Brazil's total), which was a decrease of 10% compared to 2009.

<p>
Conab's latest estimate for the <i>safrinha</i> corn crop is 20.7 million tons, but that estimate will decline in subsequent reports due to the adverse conditions in Mato Grosso.
