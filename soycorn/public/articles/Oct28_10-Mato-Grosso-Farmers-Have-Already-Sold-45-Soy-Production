Mato Grosso Farmers Have Already Sold 45% of Soy Production
<p>
	According to the Mato Grosso Institute of Agricultural Economics (Imea), farmers in Mato Grosso have already sold 45% of their anticipated 2010/11 soybean production.  This is significantly more than the 29% that was sold last year at this time.  A sack of soybeans in Mato Grosso (60 kilograms or 2.2 bushels) is currently selling at US$ 20 compared to the US$ 14 it was selling for last year at this time.  If there had not been a delayed start to soybean planting in the state, the forward selling percentage would be even higher.
