Initial Look at Argentina's 2010/11 Growing Season
<p>
Here is the first look at the 2010/11 growing season in Argentina.  A small percentage of the Argentine sunflower crop has been planted, but there are no reports of corn or soybeans being planted.  That could change later this week when farmers in Argentina prepare to start planting corn.

<b>Argentine Current Weather</b>  - Argentina has also experienced a dryer than normal and a colder than normal winter season.  The Argentine winter has been characterized by frequent frosts and snowfalls.  At one time in August, snow was recorded on the ground in the majority of Argentina's provinces.

	The driest regions of Argentina were to the west and the south in the provinces of Cordoba, La Pampa, and parts of Santa Fe, but rainfall late last week helped to relieve some of the dryness.  The wettest areas of the country were in the eastern and northern provinces of Buenos Aires, Entre Rios, and Corrientes.  More rainfall will be needed to replenish the depleted soil moisture, but last week's rains were certainly beneficial.

<b>Argentine sunflowers</b>  - The first summer crop to be planted in Argentina is usually sunflowers.  Sunflowers are planted in northern Argentina as soon as the soil warms up and there is ample moisture to insure germination and seedling establishment.  The primary planting month for sunflowers in Argentina is September.  
</p>
<p>
Currently, about 6-8% of the 2010/11 Argentine sunflower crop has been planted which is about a normal planting pace.  With recent rainfall in northern Argentina, the sunflower planting pace should now increase. 
</p>
<p>
<b>Argentine Corn</b>  - Of the two major summer crops in Argentina, soybeans and corn, corn is the first one planted.  If the planting conditions are favorable, corn planting begins in September and it wraps up usually by the end of October.  Corn planting begins in northern Argentina and progresses southward with the latest corn generally being planted in southern Buenos Aires and La Pampa.  Corn planting in Argentina is similar to the U.S. in that the earlier the corn is planted generally the better the yield prospects.  With the recent rainfall, the first fields of corn may be planted in Argentina sometime this week.  
</p>
<p>
<b>Argentine Soybeans</b>  - The soybean acreage in Argentina dwarfs all the other summer crops combined.  During the 2009/10 growing season, seven to eight times more acres of soybeans were planted compared to corn.  Soybean planting begins generally in October after the last chance of frost has passed and it won't end until the last double crop soybeans are planted generally in December.  November is the peak planting month for soybeans in Argentina.  Early planting is not critical for soybeans and soybean yields generally don't' start to taper off until planting is delayed until later in December.  There are no soybeans currently planted in Argentina.
</p>
<p>
<b>Argentine Wheat</b>  - The wheat crop in Argentina is planted generally in May and June and it is harvested generally in December.  The wheat crop in Argentina is currently breaking dormancy and entering its rapid growth phase.  Approximately 40% of Argentina's wheat acreage is in need of additional moisture.  The past weekend's rains were beneficial, but more will be needed to insure adequate moisture during flowering and grain filling.
