Dry Weather Accelerates Sugarcane Harvest in Southeastern Brazil
<p>
Dry weather in southeastern Brazil is providing several benefits for sugarcane producers in the region.  In addition to encouraging a rapid harvest and processing pace, the sugarcane being harvested is of higher quality as well.  June rainfall in southeastern Brazil has been 54% of the historical average and this is after a dryer than normal April and May.

According to the Union of Sugarcane Industries (Unica), 173 million tons of sugarcane have already been processed this growing season which is 20% more than last year at this time.  As of the middle of June, sugar production registered 8.95 million tons compared to 6.84 million tons in 2009.  Ethanol production during the same period is also up 17.5% compared to 2009 from 6.1 billion liters to 7.18 billion liters.  The sugarcane growing season in Brazil starts April 1st and goes through March 31st.

The dry weather also encourages a greater accumulation of sucrose in the harvested sugarcane.  The total sugar content of the sugarcane this year is running 23% above that of last year.  While the dry weather has allowed for a more rapid harvest pace, producers are worried that the lack of moisture may impede vegetative development of the sugarcane resulting in lower yields later in the growing season.

Of the sugarcane processed thus far this growing season, 43.3% is being used to produce sugar compared to 40.7% last growing season.  The remainder of the sugarcane is used to produce ethanol.
