Brazilian Agronomist Explain Strategies to Combat Potential Dry Weather 
<p>
	With reports that the developing La Nina may be more intense than the last one during the 2007/08 growing season, agronomist in southern Brazil are already advising their farmer clients on strategies to help minimize any potential adverse affects of the dry weather might have on their 2010/11 crops. A La Nina generally results in dryer than normal weather in southern Brazil during the spring and early summer (September to December) and eventually lower yields.

	These strategies were debated earlier this week at the 38th annual meeting of the Soybean Researchers of Southern Brazil held in Cruz Alta, Rio Grande do Sul.  The meeting was sponsored by the Central Foundation for Research and Experimentation (Fundacep).

	Their number one strategy for minimizing the affects of dry weather was to space out the planting of corn and soybeans over the entire planting window.  Instead of planting the entire crop as quickly as possible, they are recommending that the planting be broken up into separate periods with 15 day intervals between the planting periods.  That would insure that any potential moisture stress would not hit the entire crop at the same developmental stage, thus spreading out the risk.

	They also recommend planting the most drought tolerant varieties that are available and to be sure that the varieties are adapted to the region where they will be grown.  Planting varieties that might be more drought tolerant but not adapted to the region may cause more harm than good.

If the instillation of irrigation equipment is a possibility, they stress that the farmers must be certain of the water supply and the amount of water available before they invest in costly irrigation equipment.  A more economical way to conserve water supplies would be to use no-till planting.
