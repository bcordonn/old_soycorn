Mato Grosso Soybean Yields Lowest In Three Years
<p>
According to the Mato Grosso Institute of Agricultural Economics, soybean farmers in the state planted 6.2 million hectares of soybeans in 2009-10, which was nearly 9% more than the 5.7 million hectares planted in 2008-09.  The average yield in the state is estimated at 50.68 sacks per hectare (44.1 bu/ac), which is slightly less than last year and down from the record yield of 52.41 sacks per hectare (45.5 bu/ac) set in 2007-08.

Virtually all the state suffered from too much rain, but the northern region of the state and the southeastern region recorded the highest average yields in the range of 52 to 55 sacks per hectare (45 to 48 bu/ac).  The hardest hit regions were the western and south-central regions where yields were 30 to 55 sacks per hectare (26 to 48 bu/ac).

The heavier than normal rainfall during the 2009-10 growing season resulted in long periods of cloudy weather and reduced solar radiation, which is believed to be one of the causes for the lower yields recorded in the state.  Many of the short-cycle soybeans also matured during the time of heavy rains, which also caused additional harvest losses and reduced seed quality.

Even though the soybean planting in the state started approximately a month earlier than in 2008-09, the harvest wrapped up only a few days earlier than the prior year.  As of April 7th, 99% of Mato Grosso's soybeans had been harvested as compared to 95% the prior year.

The lower yields coupled with higher costs and lower prices have many farmers in the state hanging onto their soybeans in hopes of improved prices.  Approximately 65% of the soybeans in Mato Grosso have been priced which is significantly less than the normal amount for this time of the year.
