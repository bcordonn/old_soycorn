Safrinha Corn And Cotton Crops In Central Brazil Need Rain
<p>
The weather over the last several weeks in central Brazil has turned decidedly dryer.  As a result, the <i>safrinha</i> corn and cotton crops in Mato Grosso and in other parts of central Brazil are in need of rain to replenish the soil moisture that is quickly disappearing.  Approximately 60% of the <i>safrinha</i> corn in central Mato Grosso is now pollinating and it will definitely need rain by the end of April to avoid significant yield losses.  Additional rainfall will also be needed during May and June to insure adequate grain fill.  The harvest of the <i>safrinha</i>  corn crop in Mato Grosso will begin in June or July.  The majority of the <i>safrinha</i>  cotton crop in the state is not yet flowering, but it too will need rainfall within the next week or two to also avoid potential yield reductions as well.

In the municipality of Sorriso, which is located in central Mato Grosso, is one of the principal regions where <i>safrinha</i>  corn is traditionally grown, but <i>safrinha</i> cotton is also becoming popular as well.  Farmers in the municipality planted 240,000 hectares of <i>safrinha</i> corn in 2010 and 12,000 hectares of <i>safrinha</i> cotton.  <i>safrinha</i> cotton production became more popular after the introduction of shorter maturity cotton (170 day maturity) that can be planted after soybeans are harvested.  Full-season cotton (210 day maturity) is usually planted in December or early January, but the short maturity <i>safrinha</i> cotton can be planted as late as the end of February.

In the state of Mato Grosso, Conab estimates that 1.88 million hectares of <i>safrinha</i> corn were planted in 2010, which is 25% more than in 2009, and  420,000 hectares of cotton were planted in 2010, which is 8.5% more than last year.

Planting a second crop of corn or cotton in Mato Grosso is always a risky proposition due to the uncertainty of when the rainy season will end.  In 2009 the rains continued well into June and as a result, there were record <i>safrinha</i> corn yields recorded in the state.  In other years when the weather turns dry early, the yields of the second crop of corn  can be very low.
