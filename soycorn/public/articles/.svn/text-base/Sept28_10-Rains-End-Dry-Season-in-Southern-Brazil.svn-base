Rains End Dry Season in Southern Brazil
<p>
	Heavy rains have been falling in southern Brazil since late last week and they are expected to continue in the region this week as well.  In many areas these are the first rains since April and they mark the end of Brazil's extended 2010 dry season.

	As is the often the case, the first rains of the season are violent thunderstorms accompanied by hail and high winds.  That was the case in Parana over the weekend.  Violent thunderstorms raked Parana on Saturday and Sunday uprooting trees and damaging roofs.  In Londrina, which is located in northern Parana, trees were uprooted and hail was reported as more than two inches of rain fell.  In Campo Mourao, which is located in west-central Parana, 1,200 homes were damaged by the high winds and electricity was out in many parts of the city.

	The rains will facilitate the start of spring planting for the 2010/11 growing season.  Some farmers in the state had started planting their corn in anticipation of the rain and approximately 10% of the state's corn crop has been planted.  Farmers will continue planting their corn and they should start planting soybeans by the end of the week.

The dry weather had facilitated the wheat harvest in the state which is approximately 50% complete.  The high winds and hail may have damaged some of the remaining wheat, but damage estimates are not yet available.  The states of Parana and Rio Grande do Sul produce approximately 87% of Brazil's wheat crop.

	In central Brazil where the dry season has been the worst in recent memory, scattered showers have already fallen and more are expected this week.  The forecast is for 20 to 30% coverage of the showers this week in Mato Grosso, Goias, and Tocantins.  More rain will be needed of course, but at least these rains are putting more moisture in the air which should facilitate additional showers.  After such a long dry period, at least two inches of rain is needed to recharge the soil moisture enough to insure germination and stand establishment of the summer crops.
