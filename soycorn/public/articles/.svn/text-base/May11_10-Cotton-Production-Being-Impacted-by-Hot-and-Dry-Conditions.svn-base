Cotton Production Being Impacted by Hot and Dry Conditions
<p>
The prolonged period of dry weather that started more than a month ago in Mato Grosso is impacting the late-planted cotton crop in the state.  The cotton that has been impacted the most thus far is the cotton that was planted between the 10th of January and the 10th  of February.  This cotton is still in the vegetative phase and if it continues to remain dry, the eventual yields will certainly be reduced.

In contrast, the cotton that was planted in December or very early in January was far enough along in its development to escape the impact of the dry weather that started in early April.  The early-planted cotton developed under optimum conditions and the bolls are starting to open and the yield prospects are excellent. The harvest of the early planted cotton will begin approximately June 10th.  Unfortunately, only about 30% of the 430,000 hectares of cotton grown in Mato Grosso was planted during December.

The internal demand for cotton in Brazil remains strong and as a result, cash prices for cotton in Mato Grosso are currently 24% higher than what they were in May of 2009.
