Rains Slow Early Soybean Harvest In Mato Grosso
<p>
Heavy rains continue to fall in Mato Grosso and as a result, the early soybean harvest in the state is progressing slower than normal.  The soybean crop in the state advanced only 1% last week and it now stands at just 3% complete.  Last year at this time, the harvest was 1% complete in the state, but the 2008-09-soybean crop was planted several weeks later than normal due to dry weather during September and October.

Heavy rains at harvest time are always a concern for farmers in central Brazil, but there have not been any reports of yield losses thus far.  Early soybean yields in Mato Grosso are being reported in the range of 48 to 50 sacks per hectare with top yields of 55 sacks per hectare or 41.5 to 43.5 bushels per acre with top yields of 47.8 bushels per acre.  These yields are considered good for early-maturing soybeans in central Brazil.  The Mato Grosso Institute of Agricultural Economics is estimating that the statewide average soybean yield will be 3,000 kg/ha (50 sacks) or 43.5 bu/ac as compared to last year's yield of 3,052 kg/ha (51 sacks) or 44.2 bushels per acre.

As more soybeans mature in Mato Grosso heavy rains could start to impact the quality of the soybean seeds.  Mature soybean seeds start to deteriorate quickly under conditions of high temperatures and high humidity.  Harvest time in Mato Grosso can be a period of high humidity and temperatures that exceed 100 degrees.  Under those types of conditions, molds can quickly invade the seed and seeds can start to sprout while still in the pods.  Each time a mature soybean pod goes through a wet and dry cycle, the seed quality can be adversely affected.

The slower than anticipated harvest progress in Mato Grosso will also translate to slower than anticipated movement of soybeans to the Brazilian ports as well.  The source of early exportable soybeans in Brazil is usually from central Mato Grosso and western Parana.  The early harvest is progressing slowly in Mato Grosso and heavy rains are also slowing the early soybean harvest in western Parana as well.  Usually by mid-January a few early soybeans are ready for harvest in western Parana, but this year, the start of the harvest is being delayed by 1-2 weeks due to the wet weather.

The soybean importers are eagerly awaiting the start of new crop exports out of Brazil, but the 2010 Brazilian export season will probably start later than what had been anticipated.
