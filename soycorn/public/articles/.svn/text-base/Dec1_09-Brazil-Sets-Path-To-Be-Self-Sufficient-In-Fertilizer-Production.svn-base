Brazil Sets Path To Be Self-sufficient In Fertilizer Production 
<p>
Brazilian officials realize that if they want to be a world leader in food production, they cannot be dependant on imported ammonia and urea fertilizer for 70% of their fertilizer needs.  That was the conclusion of a recent meeting between the Minister of Agriculture, Reinhold Stephanes, the president of Brazil, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, and the president of Petrobras, Jose Sergio Gabrielli.  Since natural gas is the basis for ammonia and urea production, Petrobras presented plans to the president indicating that the country could be self-sufficient in ammonia and urea production within five years.

Potassium is another important fertilizer for Brazilian agriculture, but 91% of the potassium that is consumed in Brazil is imported.  Government geologists in Brazil recently announced the discovery of potassium deposits in the Amazon Region that are thought to be the third largest deposits in the world.  There are significant environmental hurdles to overcome before these potassium deposits can be developed, but President Lula announced plans to meet with specialists to address these environmental issues.  He has set a goal of 10 years for Brazil to also be self-sufficient in potassium fertilizer as well.
