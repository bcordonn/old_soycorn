Argentina More Dependent on Soybeans Than Other Major Producers
<p>
Of the three major soybean producing countries, United States, Brazil, and Argentina, its Argentina that is the most dependent on soybeans for its agricultural income.  During the last growing season, Argentine farmers planted approximately 19 million hectares of soybeans compared to 2.6 million hectares of corn.  In other words, for each hectare of corn in the country there were 7.3 hectares of soybeans.

<p>
The situation is very different in the United States where for each hectare of corn there was 0.8 hectares of soybeans.  In Brazil, thanks to the <i>safrinha</i> corn crop, for each hectare of corn there was 1.8 hectares of soybeans.
</p>
<p>
Argentine farmers are ultra dependent on soybean production due to mainly governmental tax policies and interference in the agricultural markets.  Even though the export taxes on soybeans are higher (35%) than the export taxes on corn (25%), the Argentine government does not interfere in the soybean export market.  In fact, government revenues increase as soybean exports increase and there is no reason to restrict soybean exports in order to hold down on domestic inflation.  That is not the case for corn.
</p>
<p>
When the corn supply in Argentina becomes tight, corn prices increase which drives up the cost of feed for livestock producers and the price increases are passed along to consumers in the form of higher food costs.  The increased cost of food is one of the driving factors in the ever increasing domestic inflation picture in Argentina.  As a result, the government arbitrarily restricts the amount of corn that is allowed to be exported from the country every time corn prices increase.
</p>
<p>
As far as farmers are concerned, they never know what the future price of corn will be because of this government interference in the corn export market.  Whereas for soybeans, they can look to the future markets for price direction without fear that the government will restrict soybean exports.  Therefore, farmers in Argentina would rather plant soybeans, because they are cheaper to plant and easier to sell.

<p>
The situation in Argentina may improve a little next growing season when soybean acreage is expected to decline and corn acreage is expected to increase.
