The economic ties between Brazil and China continue to expand.  In addition to soybeans, soybean oil, and iron ore, poultry can now be added to the list of the growing number of products traded between the two countries.  During the first half of 2009, Brazil exported 1.7 million tons of poultry products and of that total, 42% moved through the Port of Paranagua with China being the number one destination followed by Germany and Holland.  China is also the number one country to import products through the port.  During the first six months of 2009, 13,4% of the imports moving through the Port of Paranagua came from China, followed by Argentina at 12.1%, and Germany at 11.5%.  The exported poultry does not go directly to Mainland China, but instead moves into China via Hong Kong.  Direct exports to Mainland China are expected to begin before the end of 2009.
