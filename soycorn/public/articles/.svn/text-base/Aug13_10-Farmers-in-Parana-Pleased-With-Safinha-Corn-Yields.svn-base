Farmers in Parana Pleased With Safrinha Corn Yields
<p>	
After a delay due to wet weather, farmers in Parana are back in the fields harvesting their <i>safrinha</i> corn crop.  They generally are very pleased with this year's yields, but they are not pleased about the domestic price of corn.  In northern Parana where most of the <i>safrinha</i> is grown, yields are being reported in the range of 75 to 90 sacks per hectare or 70 to 83 bushels per acre.  These are very good yields considering that last year's drought impaired crop yielded only 46 bu/ac.

	On the price front, corn prices have improved recently, but not enough to generate any enthusiasm for the 2010/11 full season crop or the 2011 <i>safrinha</i> corn crop.  In the city of Maringa last week, the price of corn went from R$ 12.80 per sack to R$ 13.60 per sack or US$ 3.32 to US$3.53 per bushel.

Conab's latest monthly report estimates the total <i>safrinha</i> corn crop at 20.1 million tons, which represents 37% of Brazil's total corn production.  Mato Grosso is the leading <i>safrinha</i> corn producing state followed by Parana and these two states combined account for approximately 65% of the total <i>safrinha</i> production.  While the <i>safrinha</i> corn crop in Parana is turning out much better than expected, the same cannot be said of the <i>safrinha</i> crop in Mato Grosso where the early onset of the dry season reduced <i>safrinha</i> corn yields.

At current price levels, farmers in Parana are not enthusiastic about planting corn and it is anticipated that they will cut back significantly on their full season corn acreage in 2010/11 and that they will also reduce their 2011 <i>safrinha</i> corn acreage as well.
