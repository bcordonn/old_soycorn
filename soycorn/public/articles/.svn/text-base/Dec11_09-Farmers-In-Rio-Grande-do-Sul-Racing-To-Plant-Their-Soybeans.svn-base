Farmers In Rio Grande do Sul Racing To Plant Their Soybeans
<p>
Farmers in Rio Grande do Sul are using a respite from the rain to work 24 hours a day in an attempt to get their soybean crop planted before the next deluge drives them from the fields once again.  After receiving record amounts of rainfall during the month of November, the situation in Rio Grande do Sul has improved over the past week allowing the farmers to return to their fields and resume planting their 2009-10 summer crops.  Unfortunately, the forecast is calling for more rainfall in the days ahead.

At the end of November it was estimated that about 30% of the soybeans in the state had been planted and that one third of those soybeans would need to be replanted due to poor germination and stand establishment.  On December 4th, the state extension service estimated that 43% of the crop had been planted.  In recent days, farmers have been working 24 hours a day planting their crop and it is now estimated that two thirds of the soybeans have been planted.

In all likelihood, the soybean planting in Rio Grande do Sul will be completed by the end of December, which would make it about a month later than normal.  In the face of a disappointing wheat crop and low corn prices, farmers in the state will make every effort possible to plant all of their soybeans regardless of how late it is because it's the soybean crop that offers them the best opportunity to make some money this year.

Ideally, soybeans in Rio Grande do Sul should be planted in November for optimum yield potential, but soybeans planted during the month of December can still produce good yields if the weather cooperates during the remainder of the growing season.
