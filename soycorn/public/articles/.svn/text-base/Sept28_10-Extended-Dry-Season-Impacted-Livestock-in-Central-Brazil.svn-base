Extended Dry Season Impacted Livestock in Central Brazil
<p>
	Most of the news from Brazil has focused on the lack of rain and the delayed start to the planting season, but the heat and dry weather also took a toll on livestock producers in central Brazil as well.  Beef, swine, and poultry producers all reported that the exceptionally high temperatures and lack of rainfall have adversely affected their operations.

	Cattle ranchers confronted an especially dire situation if they did not have additional rations available for their cattle.  The pastures of central Brazil have been dry since May and without additional rations, most cattle lose considerable weight during the dry season.  This year, the dry season has been especially hot and dry and the cattle lost more weight than normal.  That is why so many ranchers in the area burned off their dry pastures in August and September.  Within a few days of burning, new green shoots start to appear and the cattle have something to graze for the first time in several months.  The burning though causes a tremendous amount of pollution and respiratory distress for the residents of the area.

Chicken producers in Mato Grosso reported that the adverse conditions reduced feed intake, and reduced the growth rate of their chickens.  The number of chickens per house had to be reduced due to the heat and the high temperatures increased the mortality rate.  Many poultry producers in Mato Grosso reported losses in their operations during the last several months.

Hog producers fared no better during the dry season.  Reduced feed intake and reduced growth rates during the last several months caused losses in their operations as well.

Farmers and livestock producers in central Brazil are both eagerly awaiting the return of rains and the end of what has been a brutal dry season.
