A New Sugarcane Disease Has Producers Worried
<p>
The discovery of a new sugarcane rust disease in the state of Sao Paulo has producers worried that their sugarcane yields may decline and their costs may rise as they try to control the spread of the disease.  The rust was first found in December and it has now been confirmed in eight municipalities in the state.  Australian sugarcane producers have been battling the disease for a decade and if left untreated, it can reduce sugarcane yields by up to 20%.

Scientists believe that most of the sugarcane varieties grown in Brazil are resistant to the disease, but they won't be sure until all 80 different varieties grown in Brazil are tested.  Thus far, they have only tested 34 varieties.

The two sugarcane varieties that appear most susceptible to the disease are called 454 and 1,115.  These two varieties are planted on 228,000 hectares in Sao Paulo, Mato Grosso do Sul, and Mato Grosso.  They represent about 8% of the sugarcane acreage that has been surveyed thus far for the disease.  Scientists have found three other varieties that they think are susceptible and they expect to find more susceptible varieties before the survey is complete.

The best method to control the disease is to plant resistant varieties, but that may not be an option for sugarcane already in production.  In that case, fungicide treatments may be necessary, but there are no fungicides currently registered in Brazil for the disease.  One fungicide is in the process of being licensed for sugarcane rust control, but scientists feel that fungicide treatments would be the most expensive option.  They recommend replacing susceptible varieties with resistant varieties wherever possible.

The Minister of Agriculture in the state of Sao Paulo fears that the disease could cost Brazilian sugarcane producers between R$ 300 million to R$ 1 billion per year in lost production and increase control costs.
