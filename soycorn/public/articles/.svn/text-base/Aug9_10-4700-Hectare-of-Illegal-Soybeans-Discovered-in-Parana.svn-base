4,700 Hectares of Illegal Soybeans Discovered in Parana 
<p>
	This is the time of year in Brazil when commercial soybean production is prohibited.  The 90-day soybean free period, which started five years ago in Mato Grosso, is used as a way to break the soybean rust disease cycle.  Soybean rust spores cannot survive for more than 60 days without a host plant so the idea is to eliminate soybeans as a host during the dry season.  This practice has worked well in central Brazil and it has been adopted by most soybean growing states in Brazil.

	Two years ago, the state of Parana adopted the same measure that prohibited live soybeans in the state between June 15th and September 15th.  Unfortunately, not everyone in the state has adhered to the new law.  According to the State Agricultural Department, during the month of July, they discovered 4,700 hectares of illegal soybeans growing in the state.  This is more than last year when that amount of illegal soybeans weren't discovered until at least the middle of August.  Anyone found growing illegal soybeans during this period is subject to a fine and the destruction of the crop.

These discoveries have agricultural officials very concerned about the early onset of soybean rust when planting begins during the second half of September.  Soybean rust was a bigger concern last year in Parana than during the previous several years.  Heavy rains started early last growing season and they continued right through most of the growing season.  The result was an early onset of soybean rust and more infections throughout the year.  During the 2009/10 growing season, Parana farmers averaged 1.8 fungicide applications compared to 1.3 applications during the 2008/09 growing season.

	The eventual amount of soybean rust during the 2010/11 growing season will depend on the weather condition.  A dryer than normal spring and early summer, which is the current forecast, could delay the onset of the disease.
