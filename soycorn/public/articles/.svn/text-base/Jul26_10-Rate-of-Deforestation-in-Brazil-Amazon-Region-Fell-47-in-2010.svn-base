Rate of Deforestation in Brazilian Amazon Region Fell 47% in 2010
<p>
	 The Brazilian National Institute of Space Studies (Inpe) recently announced that between August 2009 and May 2010, 1,564 square kilometers of Amazon forest was cleared compared to 2,958 square kilometers cleared during the same period a year earlier.  This represents a decline of 47% in the rate of deforestation in the Amazon Region of Brazil.

	The Environmental Minister of Brazil, Izabella Teixeira, attributes the decline to various factors including: improved satellite technology that provides "real time" data about deforestation, better monitoring by local, state and federal officials, cutting off credit for anyone convicted of illegal deforestation, and the prohibition of selling lumber or any agricultural commodities produced in areas where illegal deforestation has occurred.

	The "real time" satellite system, which was deployed in 2009, offers a quick snapshot of any deforestation, but it is not as precise as previous systems.  The real time detection system can only capture deforestation that occurs in areas greater than 50 hectares (half a square kilometer or 122 acres).  While not a precise as the old system, it is much faster and allows state and local officials to be notified as soon as any illegal deforestation is detected.  The old system was more precise, but it could only detect deforestation a year after it had occurred.  This new and faster system can detect deforestation almost as it is occurring which allows for much better enforcement of environmental laws.

	Monitoring of the huge Amazon Region of Brazil can only be accomplished using satellite technology.  The Amazon Region of Brazil encompasses 4.2 million square kilometers and represents 48% of Brazil's total land area.  During the month of May 2010, the most deforestation occurred in the state of Mato Grosso where 51.9 square kilometers were deforested followed by the state of Para (37.2 square kilometers), Rondonia (10.7 square kilometers), and Amazonas (9.8 square kilometers).
