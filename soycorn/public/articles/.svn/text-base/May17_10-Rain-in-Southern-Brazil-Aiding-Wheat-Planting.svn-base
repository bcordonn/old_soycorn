Rain in Southern Brazil Aiding Wheat Planting
<p>
Wheat is the principal small grain grown in southern Brazil and recent rains have benefited the crop.  The states of Parana and Rio Grande do Sul account for nearly 90% of all the wheat grown in Brazil.  The two states combined are expected to produce 4.43 million tons of Brazil's total wheat production estimated at 5.1 million tons.

The state of Parana did not receive any rain during the first half of April and farmers were concerned that the lack of soil moisture would impede wheat planting and germination.  Wheat is planted during May and June in southern Brazil and harvested during October and November.  A series of frontal systems started to move across southern Brazil during the second half of April and the first half of May.  The resulting rainfall improved soil moisture and encouraged farmers to start planting their 2010 wheat crop.

In Parana, farmers will plant an estimated 1.1 million hectares of wheat, which is 16% less than the 1.3 million planted in 2009.  Even though the acreage is down, the total production is expected to surpass the drought plagued crop of 2009.  The 2010 wheat production in Parana is estimated at 2.94 million tons, which is approximately 10% more than the 2.67 million tons produced in 2009.

In addition to wheat, farmers in southern Brazil plant other small grains as well such as oats, barley, rye, canola, and triticale.

The rains have also helped the <i>safrinha</i>  corn production, which is produced in northern Parana.  The cold fronts also brought with them cold temperatures and patchy frost in southern Parana.  The cold weather slowed the corn development, but no lasting damage occurred to the crop. When combining the first and second crops of corn, the state of Parana is expected to produce 12.6 million tons of corn or 23% of Brazil's total production.
