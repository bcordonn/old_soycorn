Brazilian Farmers Quickly Adopting GMO Corn Hybrids
<p>
	Brazilian farmers continue to increase the amount of GMO corn hybrids they are planting on their farms.  During the 2009/10 growing season, it is estimated that 32.5% of the corn grown in Brazil was GMO.  For the 2010/11 growing season, which will be planted starting in a month or so, it is estimated that 55% of the corn grown in Brazil will be GMO.  Approximately 43% of the GMO corn in Brazil is insect resistant.  Three and a half percent of the corn hybrids are herbicide resistant and one percent has both insect and herbicide resistance.

	In the tropical climate of Brazil, insect pressures are significant and the farmers have generally been very pleased with the results of the insect resistant GMO corn hybrids.  Reports indicate that the GMO corn hybrids can yield up to 15% to 20% higher than conventional hybrids.

	The majority of the GMO corn is grown in southern Brazil where it is utilized for both livestock feed and human consumption.  In the domestic market, GMO and traditional hybrids are kept separate because the consumer does not demand it, but all is not calm on the biotech front.  Recently, a federal judge in Parana prohibited the release of "Liberty Link" corn from Bayer CropScience until an acceptable monitoring plan had been developed even though the   National Commission for Biosecurity (CTNBio) had approved the use of the hybrid in 2008.

	Some Brazilian farmers feel that there will continue be a market for traditional crop varieties (non GMO) especially in Europe.  European buyers paid a 50 cent premium for traditional soybean varieties from Brazil this year and more European buyers are looking for traditional corn supplies from Brazil as well.  Brazil is the only remaining large corn exporter where GMO corn hybrids are in the minority, at least they were this past growing season.  Additionally, the GMO corn hybrids that are currently being grown in Brazil are generally the same GMO corn hybrids that have already been approved in Europe.
