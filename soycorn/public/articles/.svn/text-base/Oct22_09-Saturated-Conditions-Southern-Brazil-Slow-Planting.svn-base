Saturated Conditions In Southern Brazil Slow Planting Progress
<p>
Farmers in southern Brazil continue to be frustrated in their efforts to plant their 2009-10 corn and soybean crops due to saturated conditions.  In northern Parana for example, October rainfall has already far surpassed the normal for the month and unfortunately there is more rain in the forecast.  At least three or four days of sunny weather would be needed for field activity to resume.  Farmers in southern Brazil plant their full-season corn starting in early September and they would like to have all of their corn planted by the end of October if possible.  If they cannot plant their corn in a timely fashion, they will switch some of their intended corn acreage to additional soybean acreage.

Low domestic corn prices and a high cost of production have already convinced farmers in southern Brazil to cut back on their corn acreage.  Parana is the largest corn producing state in Brazil and the anticipated 2009-10-corn acreage in the state is expected to decline by 20% or more.  If wet conditions keep farmers out of the field for several more weeks, the farmers in southern Brazil will quickly switch some of their corn acreage into soybean production.

<h4>Conditions in central Brazil nearly ideal of soybean planting</h4>
<p>
In contrast to southern Brazil, the conditions in central Brazil have been nearly ideal for early soybean planting.  In Mato Grosso and Goias the rainy season started in September and the rains have been consistent ever since.  Abundant soil moisture in central Brazil has encouraged rapid germination and good stand establishment of the 2009-10 soybean crop.

 In Mato Grosso 25-30% of the intended soybeans have been planted, which is nearly double last year's pace.  Early planting of soybeans in central Brazil is important for several reasons.  First and foremost, early-planted soybeans can progress through their important reproductive cycles of flowering and pod filling before major outbreaks of soybean rust.  This allows farmers to spend less on control measures, thus reducing costs.  Secondly, early-planted soybeans allow time for farmers to plant a second crop of corn or cotton after the initial soybean crop is harvested.
