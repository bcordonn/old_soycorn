Crop Progress Slows Resulting in Lower Early 2010 Yield Estimates
<p>
The once rapid start to the 2010 growing season has been slowed by the recent cooler and wetter conditions.  So much so, that the corn crop today is maybe, maybe a week ahead of normal.  As a result, there is a little less optimism about the start to the growing season and as a result, the initial corn yield estimate has been lowered.  The initial corn yield had been estimated in the range of 165 to 170 bushels per acre, but now it has been lowered by two bushels on each end putting the new estimate at 163 to 168 bushels per acre.

For soybeans, it was thought that the crop would also get off to a quick start as well, but that too has been compromised by the recent cooler and wetter pattern.  Currently, it is estimated that the soybean crop is getting off to about a normal type of start.  Therefore, the initial soybean yield estimate has been lowered as well.  It had been estimated that the soybean yield would be in the range of 44 to 46 bushels per acre, but now that has been lowered by one bushel on each end to 43 to 45 bushels per acre.
