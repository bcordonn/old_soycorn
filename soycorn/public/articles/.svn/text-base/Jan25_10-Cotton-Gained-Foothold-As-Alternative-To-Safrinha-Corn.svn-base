Cotton Gaining Foothold As Alternative To Safrinha Corn
<p>
As farmers in Mato Grosso harvest their early-maturing soybeans, they are also planting their second crop called the <i>safrinha</i>.  The vast majority of the <i>safrinha</i> acreage is devoted to corn production, but in 2010 there will be a significant amount of second crop cotton planted as well.  This new type of short-stature cotton is gaining a foothold as a second crop in Mato Grosso.  In 2009, farmers in Mato Grosso planted 7,000 hectares of this new cotton.  In 2010, it is expected that they will plant 52,000 hectares of this cotton.  Mato Grosso currently accounts for approximately 50% of Brazil total cotton production and 60% of Brazil cotton exports.

The short-stature cotton can be planted as a second crop because of its shorter life cycle, which is a short as 150 days, compared to traditional cotton varieties, which have life cycles of 200 to 210 days.  These short cycle cottons can be planted as late as February 15th and still have time to mature before the rainy season ends and the dry season begins.  The conventional cotton varieties are generally planted in December and cannot be planted after January 15th.

This short-stature cotton offers two significant advantages over conventional cotton varieties.  First of all, it is cheaper to grow due to the shorter time it is in the field and the reduced amounts of insecticides needed to control pests.  The cost of producing conventional cotton in Brazil is between US$ 2,200 to US$ 2,300 per hectare.  The cost of production for the new cotton is between US$ 1,000 to US$ 1,200 per hectare.  The yields are less with the short-stature cotton, but the profits per hectare can be higher.  The other significant advantage of the cotton is the fact that it can be planted as a double crop after soybeans and it offers an alternative to corn.  Currently, domestic corn prices are low in Brazil due to abundant supplies and disappointing exports.  As a result, farmers are looking for an alternative to safrinha corn and cotton now offers that alternative.

The new cotton is planted in narrow 18-inch rows compared to the traditional varieties that are planted in 36-inch rows.
