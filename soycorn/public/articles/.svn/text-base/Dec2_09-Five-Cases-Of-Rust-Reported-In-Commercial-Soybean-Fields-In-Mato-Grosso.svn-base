Five Cases Of Rust Reported In Commercial Soybean Fields In Mato Grosso
<p>
Five cases of soybean rust have been confirmed in commercial soybean fields growing in Mato Grosso.  All the cases thus far have been in the southern part of the state where soybean planting is now wrapping up.  Mini laboratories have been set up throughout the state in order to collect and analyze leaf samples and thus far, more than 300 samples have been tested.

The early onset of the rainy season had many farmers and scientist worried that soybean rust would start early as well.  During the last growing season, the first confirmed case of rust in Mato Grosso wasn't detected until December.  Nationwide, 42 cases of rust have been confirmed with the most cases in the state of Parana followed by Tocantins and then Mato Grosso.

According to the Mato Grosso Institute of Agricultural Economics, the average soybean farmer in Mato Grosso is planning on applying three fungicide applications this season in order to control the disease.  These three applications will cost between R$ 80 and R$ 120 per hectare or US$ 19.00 to 28.00 per acre.  On a statewide basis, the cost of producing soybeans in Mato Grosso this growing season is estimated at between R$ 1,200 to R$ 1,300 per hectare (US$ 282 to US$ 306 per acre), which is down about 15% compared to last year.  Soybean farmers are concerned that if the disease is worse than expected, they may need to invest in one or two more fungicide applications, thus eating into their already this profits.

The 42 cases of rust reported nationwide are the most cases of rust on December 1st for the last five years.  In three of the last five years (the 2005-06, 2007-08, and 2008-09 growing seasons) virtually no cases of rust had been confirmed on December 1st.
