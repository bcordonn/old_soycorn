Imea Increases Safrinha Corn Yields in Mato Grosso to 92.4 bu/ac
<p>
	The weather in central Brazil continues to benefit the development of the safrinha corn crop especially in Mato Grosso.  Even though a significant portion of the crop was planted after the ideal planting window, good weather and good control of insects has led to increasing yield estimates.

<p>
	The most advanced corn in Mato Grosso is filling grain and only several weeks away from being mature.  The later planted corn in Mato Grosso will be pollinating over the next two weeks and it looks like there will be enough soil moisture for successful pollination.

	The Mato Grosso Institute of Agricultural Economics (Imea) has increased its yield estimate for the safrinha corn in the state from its previous estimate of 85.9 sacks per hectare (5,154 kg/ha or 79 bu/ac) to 100.0 sacks per hectare (6,000 kg/ha or 92.4 bu/ac) and they indicated that the yield estimate might even move higher.  Imea is now estimating the safrinha corn production in the state at 17.8 million tons or 16% more than its previous estimate of 15.3 million tons.  Even though the safrinha corn acreage declined 7.9% this year, the eventual production may end up being equal to that of last year.

	In the neighboring state of Mato Grosso do Sul the news about the safrinha corn crop is optimistic as well.  As much as 30% of the safrinha corn in the state was planted after the ideal planting window, but according to surveys conducted by the Association of Soybean and Corn Producers in Mato Grosso do Sul (Aprosoja/MS), the rainfall in the state has been uniform and farmers have done a good job controlling diseases, insects, and weeds.  As a result, they are expecting very good safrinha corn yields this growing season.

	In the state of Parana, 62% of the safrinha corn is pollinated or beyond with 24% filling grain and 3% mature.  The safrinha corn in Parana is now rated 98% good and 2% average.
