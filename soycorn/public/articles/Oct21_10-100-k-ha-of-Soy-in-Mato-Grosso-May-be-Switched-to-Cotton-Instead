100 k ha of Soy in Mato Grosso May be Switched to Cotton Instead
<p>
	The delays in soybean planting in Mato Grosso has farmers in the state wondering if there will be enough time after the soybeans are harvested to still plant a second crop of corn or cotton.  In some parts of Mato Grosso the soybean planting has been delayed 30 days or more and planting will not commence until the rainfall frequency increases.

	Generally in central Mato Grosso, if the soybeans are planted before the end of October, there is still enough time to plant a second crop of corn or cotton after the soybeans are harvested.  If the soybeans are planted during November, there is generally not enough time for a second crop without the risk of significant yield losses.  In Lucas do Rio Verde and Tapurah, which are both located in central Mato Grosso, only about 3% to 5% of the soybeans have been planted compared to the 50% that was planted last year at this time.  The central region of Mato Grosso is responsible for planting about 40% of Mato Grosso's soybeans and it is the main region of the state where <i>safrinha</i> cotton is planted after the soybeans are harvested.

	The principal second crop that is planted in Mato Grosso is corn and the planting window for <i>safrinha</i> corn generally opens in early January and it closes about the middle of February.  If the corn is planting after the middle of February, there is the risk of losing the seed and inputs as well as having a greatly reduced yield potential.  If the <i>safrinha</i> corn is planted too late, the rainy season may end before the crop has time to complete grain filling.

	In recent years, the farmers in the state have also started to plan more <i>safrinha</i> cotton as well.  The planting window for <i>safrinha</i> cotton is basically the same as it is for corn.  Farmers usually plant shorter cycle cotton varieties for the second crop (170 day maturity vs. 210 day maturity for full season cotton), but even with a shorter cycle, <i>safrinha</i> cotton should not be planted after about February 20th.  If planted later than that, there is a significant risk of lower yields.

	Some farmers have already given up the idea of planting early maturing soybeans to be followed by a second crop of cotton.  Instead, they are forgoing planting soybeans and will wait until December and plant full season cotton.  As a result, As many as 100,000 hectares of soybeans may be switched to cotton production instead.  Cotton offers a better return for the farmers and they may have contracts for cotton that need to be filled.
