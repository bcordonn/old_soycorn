Sugarcane Rust Continues To Spread In Brazil
<p>
The Center for Sugarcane Technology in Piracicaba, Sao Paulo recently announced that their monitoring of sugarcane rust indicates that the disease has spread far beyond the borders of the state of Sao Paulo into the states of Espirito Santo, Minas Gerais, Parana, and Mato Grosso do Sul.  Sugarcane rust was first identified in Brazil in late 2009, but sugarcane producers in Asia and Australia have been battling the disease for more than a decade.  The disease first appeared in the United States in 2008 and has subsequently spread to Mexico and various countries in Central America.

Approximately 80 different varieties of sugarcane are grown in Brazil and the Center for Sugarcane Technology is in the process of testing all the varieties for tolerance to the disease.  Most of the varieties appear to be tolerant to the rust, but four varieties, BR 72454, SP 891115, SP 842025, and CV 14, appear to be highly susceptible to the disease.  Unfortunately, these four varieties are planted on 12% of Brazil's sugarcane acreage.  The researchers recommend that these four varieties be eliminated and the fields be replanted to resistant varieties.  That of course is easier said than done.
