U.S. Corn Crop Maturing Too Quickly
<p>
	Several factors seem to be limiting the corn yield potential this year.  One of the main factors is the high temperatures which have been pushing along the corn development much too fast.  This rapid maturity does not give the plant enough time to slowly fill the kernel.  Instead, the kernels are filled too quickly resulting in potentially smaller kernels that have lighter weights.  This rapid maturity is a concern all across the central and southern Corn Belt.

	Another concern for the corn crop is the lack of nitrogen to properly finish the crop.  The heavy rains earlier in the summer leached out some of the nitrogen to below the root zone.  This lack of nitrogen is what is causing many corn fields to turn light green or yellowish green earlier in the summer instead of the dark emerald green color typical of healthy corn plants.

The lack of nitrogen to finish the crop could also be contributing to tip back on the ears.  Tip back occurs when the last few kernels on the ear are aborted leaving the last one or two inches barren of kernels.  The nitrogen shortage could contribute to smaller kernels and lighter kernels than expected.

The lack of nitrogen is probably also contributing to the faster than normal maturity of the crop.  When a corn plant fills the kernels, it translocates nutrients from the lower leaves to the ear to fill the kernels.  If the plant runs out of nutrients (nitrogen) prematurely, this translocation process starts earlier than normal resulting in the premature drying of the lower leaves which we have seen in many parts of the Corn Belt this summer.  If the total amount of nutrients available to the plant is less than ideal, the eventual yield will be less than ideal as well.
