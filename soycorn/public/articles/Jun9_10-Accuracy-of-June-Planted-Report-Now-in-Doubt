Accuracy of June Planted Report Now in Doubt
<p>
This week, the USDA is finishing the nationwide survey for the June Planted Report, which will be released on June 30th.  Since the corn crop had been planted earlier than normal this year, it was assumed that the planted report would be quite accurate, but that assumption may now be in doubt.  The heavy rains across southern Iowa, northern Missouri, central Illinois, north-central Indiana, and northwestern Ohio has drowned out some of the crops which now must either be replanted, claimed under insurance, or switched to another crop.

The problem is that part of the planted survey may have been conducted before the heavy rains occurred.  As a result, it is possible that the June Planted Report will overestimate the actual 2010 corn acreage and underestimate the actual 2010 soybean acreage.  The additional soybean acreage though will be late-planted with potentially lower yield potential compared to soybeans planted at the normal time.
