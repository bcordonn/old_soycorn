Dry Weather in Central Brazil Could Delay Soybean Planting
<p>
	Over the past week there have been a few light and widely scattered showers in far western Mato Grosso.  Ninety five percent of central Brazil is still waiting for the first showers of the new growing season.  Temperatures in central Brazil are near 100 degrees and the relative humidity is extremely low.  The air is full of smoke and dust and everyone has their eyes to the skies looking for that first rain.

	Farmers in central Brazil are allowed to plant soybeans starting on Thursday, September 16th, but very few if any soybeans are expected to be planted due to the dry conditions in the vast majority of the area.

	In contrast to central Brazil, the rains continue to fall in Rio Grande do Sul in southern Brazil.  Corn planting has slowly been starting in the state, but dryer weather is needed before the planting pace will accelerate.
