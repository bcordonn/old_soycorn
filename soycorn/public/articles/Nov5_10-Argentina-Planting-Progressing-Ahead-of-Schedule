Argentina Planting Progressing Ahead of Schedule
<p>
	Prior to the start of the planting season in Argentina, there was widespread concern that La Nina would result in dry weather in Argentina that could disrupt the planting of 2010/11 corn and soybean crops.  Up until now, La Nina has not affected spring planting which has progressed ahead of the normal planting pace.  Farmers are taking advantage of the good conditions to plant their crops as quickly as possible.

Thus far this planting season, good weather and adequate soil moisture has propelled corn and soybean planting in Argentina.  The corn crop in Argentina is approximately 75% planted compared to 70% last year and approximately 20% of the soybeans have been planted compared to 15% in 2009/10.  The early condition of both crops is reported to be good or very good.

	The growing season has just barely begun and no one knows what the weather will be for the remainder of the growing season.  The last La Nina, which occurred in 2008/09, resulted in the worst drought in Argentina in recent memory.  Crop yields in Argentina were severely reduced and hundreds of thousands of cattle perished due to the drought.  No one is expecting anything similar to happen this growing season, but farmers in Argentina want to get their crops up and growing as soon as possible.

The planting window in Argentina is not as wide as it is in Brazil and early planting of the corn and soybean crops in Argentina is important to ensure enough time for the crops to mature before potential season ending frosts occur.

The Minister of Agriculture in Argentina estimates that the 2009/10 soybean crop will be 52 million tons compared to 52.7 million tons produced in 2009/10.  For corn, the Minister estimates that the 2010/11 crop will be 26 million tons compared to 22.7 million tons produced in 2009/10.  Argentina is the third leading exporter of soybeans in the world after the United States and Brazil, but it is the leading exporter of soybean meal and soybean oil.  Argentina is also a leading exporter of corn as well.
