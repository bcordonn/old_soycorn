Mato Grosso Farmers May Now Start Planting Soybeans
<p>
	The 90-day soybean free period in Mato Grosso has now ended and farmers may start planting their 2010/11 soybean crop if the local conditions are right.  This prohibition period, which has been in place for five years, was designed to slow the early spread of soybean rust into newly planted soybean fields.  Live soybean plants are prohibited in the state between June 15th and September 15th.

	The reason for the prohibition of having any live soybean plants in the state is to stem the early spread of soybean rust.  The spores of the disease cannot survive for more than 60 days without a host plant.  There are many other types of tropical legumes that can serve as host, but soybeans are the main one and by eliminating the primary host, it is hoped that the early spread of the disease will be slowed.

	Researchers also feel that the extended dry season and the low relative humidity that is currently in place across much of central Brazil will also help to slow the early spread of the disease.  This is in direct contrast to last year when the rains started early and so too did the disease.  In some of the wetter areas of central Brazil, soybean farmers had to spray up to five times during the last growing season to adequately control the disease.

	Farmers in central Brazil are now waiting for the first rains of the season to start planting their summer crops.
