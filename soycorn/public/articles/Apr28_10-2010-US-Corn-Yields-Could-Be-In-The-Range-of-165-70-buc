2010 U.S. Corn Yields Could be In the Range of 165-170 bu/ac

With 50% of the U.S. corn crop now planted, it's time to look ahead to what this might mean for corn yields in 2010.  Early planting is advantageous for yields for a number of reasons.  It allows pollination to occur earlier in the summer when there is less probability of hot and dry conditions.   Early planting extends the growing season so there is less probability of damages from an early frost.  Another very important factor is the fact that early planting allows the corn plant to achieve its maximum leaf area earlier in the summer when there is maximum solar radiation.  This encourages more photosynethic activity which could potentially lead to higher yields.

Early corn planting has many advantages and therefore we should anticipate very good corn yields in 2010 provided that there is no adverse weather during the growing season.  Therefore, I am going to start out the 2010 growing season anticipating that the U.S. corn yield could fall in the range of 165 to 170 bushels per acre.  After a good start like this, if the growing season has good weather, this could be the year that we really test the maximum yield potential for the new corn genetics.  We have not had an opportunity like this since 2004 and corn genetics have improved significantly in the intervening years.  If the remaining 50% of the corn crop is planted under good conditions, then I would be inclined to move toward the upper end of my yield range.
