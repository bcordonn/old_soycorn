Early Heat Wave Hits Northern Argentina
<p>
Late last week and over the weekend, extremely high temperatures were recorded in northern and western Argentina.  The highest temperatures of 110-115 degrees were recorded in the provinces of Santiago Del Estero, Tucuman, and Catamarca in northwestern Argentina.  Temperatures are expected to remain over 100 degrees for several more days in the far northern provinces.  The same areas hit by the high temperatures are also the same areas where the soil moisture is the lowest.  The region has received only sparse rainfall this spring after nearly two years of drought.  While the soil moisture has been recharged in central Argentina, it has not been replenished in Argentina's northern provinces.

As far as soybeans and corn production is concerned, these areas are minor producing regions, but they have been growing in importance in recent years.  Approximately 15% (3 million hectares) of Argentina's soybean acreage is planted in the region where the temperatures have been the hottest.  The start of the soybean planting in the region has been delayed due to the dry conditions.  Less than 1% of the soybeans in northwestern Argentina have been planted and farmers will not resume planting until additional moisture is received.

Roughly 140,000 hectares of corn are planted in the same region, which is about 7% of Argentina's 2009-10 corn acreage.  Corn planting in the region has been slow as well with less than 10% of the corn planted.  There have been reports of spotty germination and poor plant populations in the region and corn planting will remain very slow while the farmers wait for additional moisture.
