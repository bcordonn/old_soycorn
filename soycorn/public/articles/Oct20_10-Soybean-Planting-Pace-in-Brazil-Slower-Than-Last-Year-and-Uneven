Soybean Planting Pace in Brazil Slower Than Last Year and Uneven
<p>
	Nationwide the Brazilian soybean crop is approximately 8% planted compared to 13% last year and 8% average.  Even though planting pace is about average, it's slower than average in central Brazil and faster than average in southern Brazil.  Below is a look at the three main 
</p>
<p>
<b>Mato Grosso soybeans</b> - Weekend rains were very good in parts of Mato Grosso (we got 1.8 inches in Rondonopolis) and for those who received the good rains, they will be planting in full force this week.  Even with the rains of this past weekend, there are still farmers in Mato Grosso waiting for that one good rain so they can start planting their soybeans.  In many regions of the state, there have only been several lighter showers.  The Mato Grosso Institute of Agricultural Economics (Imea) indicates that about 7% of the crop has been planted (450,000 of the 6.24 million hectares).  This is well behind the 29% that was planted last year at this time.  Planting is most advanced in the western part of the state where the rainfall has been more widespread and the planting is slowest in the northern and eastern parts of the state.

<p>
	Agronomists are warning the farmers not to get too anxious to plant because they may end up having to replant their crop if the germination and stand establishment is unacceptable.  There are reports of farmers having planted two or three weeks ago in anticipation of a rain, but their soybeans have not yet germinated.  As of last Friday, 70% to 80% of the state has received less rainfall than average for the month of October.  The weekend rains were some of the best thus far this year and the forecast is calling for increased opportunities for rainfall during the last two weeks of October.
</p>
<p>
	The ideal time to plant soybeans in Mato Grosso is during the month of October, but many farmers want to plant as early as possible to allow enough time for a second crop of corn, which is planted after the soybeans are harvested.  The soybean planting window in Mato Grosso doesn't close until the second half of November.
</p>
<p>
	The delayed start to soybean planting in the state could impact the amount of <i>safrinha</i> corn that gets planted after the soybeans are harvested.  If soybeans are planted after the end of October, there will not be enough time to plant the <i>safrinha</i> corn without the risk of significant yield reductions.
</p>
<p>
	<b>Mato Grosso corn</b> - Just as a reminder, 95% of the corn grown in Mato Grosso is planted after the soybeans are harvested.  This <i>safrinha</i> corn acreage has been steadily increasing in recent years, but the delayed start to soybean planting in the state could eventually result in a decline in <i>safrinha</i> corn acreage in 2010/11.  Generally, <i>safrinha</i> corn is only planted after soybeans that were planted before the end of October.  If the soybeans are planted in November, there is not enough time to insure an acceptable second crop of corn before the onset of the next dry season.
</p>
<p>
<b>Parana soybeans</b> - For the first time in a number of years, soybean planting in Parana is ahead of the soybean planting progress in Mato Grosso.  The Department of Rural Economics (Deral) in Parana indicates that 18% of the 2010/11 soybean crop has been planted, which is ahead of the 14% that was planted last year at this time.  Farmers in northern Parana are planting as quickly as possible to insure there is enough time to plant a second crop of corn after the soybeans are harvested.  Last year, 40% of Parana's soybeans had been planted by the end of October and it seems likely that more than that will be planted by the end of this October.
</p>
<p>
Deral estimates that the farmers in Parana will plant Parana 4.49 million hectares of soybeans in 2010/11, which is up from the 4.37 million hectares planted last year.
</p>
<p>
	<b>Parana corn</b> - The corn crop in Parana is approximately 60% to 65% planted, which is slower than the normal planting pace for the state.  The planting window for corn in the state will be closing by the end of October.  In reality, farmers in the state would like to have their corn planted by the first half of October, but dry weather prevented that from happening this year.  It is possible that the corn acreage in Parana will end up being lower than what had originally been expected due to the fact that some farmers will switch some of their intended corn acres into additional soybean production.  
</p>
<p>
	<b>Parana wheat</b> - The Parana wheat harvest is approaching 80% complete, which is a little ahead of last year's pace.  Reduced wheat acreage and better harvest weather is accelerating the harvest pace.  The wheat acreage in Parana declined 13% in 2010 from 1.3 million hectares in 2009 to 1.1 million hectares in 2010.  Wheat yields are up 37% compared to last year at 2,899 kilograms per hectare (approximately 45 bu/ac).  The wheat yield in 2009 (2,000 kilograms per hectare or 31 bu/ac) was negatively impacted by heavy rainfall during the harvest period.  Parana is expected to produce 3.21 million tons of wheat, which is 20% more than in 2009.  
</p>
<p>
While the harvest is progressing quickly, the farmers in the state are having a hard time selling their wheat because local millers prefer to buy cheaper wheat from Paraguay and Uruguay.  The imported wheat is currently cheaper due to the strength of the Brazilian currency. 
</p>
<p>
<b>Rio Grande do Sul soybeans</b> - The farmers in Rio Grande do Sul are just getting started on planting their 2010/11 soybean crop.  Approximately 2% of the estimated 4.084 million hectares of soybeans have been planted, which is about normal for the third week of October.  Rio Grande do Sul always has the latest planted soybean crop in southern Brazil.  
</p>
<p>
<b>Rio Grande do Sul corn</b> - The farmers in Rio Grande do Sul have planted approximately 55% of their 2010/11 corn crop which is ahead of average.  The farmers are reporting that the germination and seedling establishment of the corn is good.
</p>
<p>
<b>Rio Grande do Sul wheat</b> - Farmers in the state have harvested approximately 5% of the 2010 wheat crop with another 20% mature and awaiting harvest.  The farmers planted 7% less wheat than last year.  They are expected to harvest 1.6 million tons in 2010 with an average yield of 2,100 kilograms per hectare (approximately 32 bu/ac).  The quality of the wheat is good and it's certainly much better than last year's wheat when a significant portion of the crop was considered only feed quality
