John Deer To Increase Production In Southern Brazil
<p>
John Deer announced that it will be hiring 250 new workers during April and May to increase production in its factory in Horizontina, which is located in Rio Grande do Sul.  According to Alferdo Neto, corporate spokesman for John Deer's South American Division, the increased demand for agricultural equipment is the result of record crops in Brazil and Argentina and government incentives in Brazil to purchase new agricultural equipment.  The government program, called the Investment Support Program (Programa de Sustentacaodo Investimento - PSI), was set to expire in mid-2010, but it has been extended until the end of 2010.  The Horizontina facility builds agricultural equipment for both Brazil and Argentina.
