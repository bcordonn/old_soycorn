Planting Progress Slows In Argentina Due To Dry Conditions
<p>
The farmers in Argentina report that they have planted approximately 12% of their intended soybean acreage as compared to 30% planted last year at this time.  Soybean planting in Argentina is progressing slower than normal for several reasons.  First of all, in north-central and northwestern Argentina, the lack of adequate rainfall has left the soil moisture below what is needed for adequate germination.  Secondly, in the far southern production regions, the temperatures have been too cool for rapid planting and germination.

The most advanced soybean planting (20-30% planted) is in southern Santa Fe, eastern Cordoba, Entre Rios, northern La Pampa, and western Buenos Aires.  This is considered the heart of the soybean production region of Argentina.  In the northern and northwestern production regions only 0-2% of the soybeans have been planted.  The spring rainfall has been inadequate to recharge the soil moisture in this region and very high temperatures hit the area late last week and into the earl part of this week.  The temperatures have since cooled, but the rainfall remains below normal.  This area encompasses approximately 30-40% of Argentina's intended soybean acreage.  The soybean-planting window in Argentina remains open until at least early December, but the earlier the soybean are planted, generally the higher the yield prospects for the crop.

The Argentine corn crop is also being planted slower than normal with 67% planted compared to 73% planted last year.  The most advanced corn planting is also in southern Santa Fe, eastern Cordoba, Entre Rios, and western Buenos Aires where 85-95% of the corn has been planted.  The slowest corn planting is in the dryer areas of northern Argentina where only 10-40% of the corn has been planted.  In the heart of the production area, the corn is in the 4-6-leaf stage and the condition of the crop varies between poor to good depending on the soil moisture.

It's still very early in the growing season of course, but hot and dry conditions now affect approximately 20-30% of the corn-producing region of Argentina.  Some of the earliest planted corn was affected by frost earlier in October and now dry weather may become a concern for corn in the northern regions.  Argentine farmers cut back significantly on their corn acreage in favor of planting more soybeans.
