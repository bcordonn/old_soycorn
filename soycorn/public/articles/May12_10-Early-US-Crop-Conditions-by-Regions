Early U.S. Crop Conditions by Regions
<p>
The weekly crop condition reports won't start for a few more weeks, so in the mean time, here are the U.S. crop conditions by region.
</p>
<h4>Eastern Corn Belt (Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Michigan)</h4>
<ul>
<li>the planting started very early, but progress has slowed due to cooler and wetter conditions</li>
<li>corn is generally being planted 10-14 days ahead of the normal pace and the soybeans are being planted maybe 7 days ahead of the normal pace</li> 
<li>corn emergence is running about 7-10 days ahead of normal </li>
<li>recent heavy rains in the far eastern Corn Belt will slow planting progress</li>
<li>soil moisture in the region is generally adequate to surplus</li>
<li>need warmer and dryer weather
</ul>

<h4>Western Corn Belt (Iowa, Nebraska, Minnesota, Kansas)</h4>
<ul>
<li>the planting is progressing generally 7-10 days ahead of the normal planting pace</li>
<li>corn emergence is about 7-10 days ahead of normal</li>
<li>cool weather will continue to slow germination and emergence</li>
<li>any weekend frost damage to corn should be minimal </li>
<li>soil moisture in the region is generally adequate</li>
<li>need warmer and dryer weather</li>
</ul>

<h4>Northwestern Corn Belt (North Dakota, South Dakota, NW Minnesota)</h4>
<ul>
<li>field work started early, but progress has slowed due to cooler and wetter conditions</li>
<li>corn planting ahead of normal, soybean planting normal or slightly behind</li>
<li>cold weather will slow planting progress</li>
<li>less than 10% of corn emerged, weekend frost damage to corn was minimal</li>
<li>soil moisture in the region is generally adequate to surplus</li>
<li>need warmer weather</li>
</ul>
 
<h4>Southern Corn Belt and mid-South (Kentucky, Tennessee, Missouri, Arkansas, Mississippi)</h4>
<ul>
<li>weather has not been good in this region for the last 7-10 days</li>
<li>heavy rains on the first weekend of May in Tennessee, Kentucky, and other parts of the mid-South set back planting progress and will result in some corn being drowned out and will need to be replanted</li>
<li>some corn acreage will probably be switched to soybeans </li>
<li>planting progressed only a few percent last week</li>
<li>soil moisture in the region is generally surplus</li>
<li>low lying areas could have standing water for several weeks</li>
<li>any additional rainfall would be detrimental</li>
</ul>
