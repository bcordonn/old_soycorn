Extended Dry Season Good for Brazilian Honey Producers
<p>
	The clear skies and dry weather that has many Brazilian farmers concerned is turning out to be just the right kind of weather for Brazilian honey producers.  Many trees in southern Brazil are in full bloom and the honey bees are taking full advantage of the abundant flower supply.  Honey extraction in Brazil will start in October or November, depending on the region, and continue until March.  Honey producers in southern Brazil are expecting a good production this year.  Last year, heavy rains in southern Brazil during October and November resulted in reduced honey production.

	According to IBGE, the largest honey producing state in Brazil is Rio Grande do Sul with 7,418 tons of honey produced in 2009.  Parana came in second with 4,635 tons of production. Total Brazilian honey production per year is approximately 60,000 tons between table honey (more clear) and industrial honey.  Most is consumed domestically, but 25,000 tons are exported to Europe and the United States on an annual basis.

	Low domestic consumption has many honey producers worried.  In 2009, the per capita consumption of honey in Brazil was just 128 grams, whereas in some other countries, the per capita consumption is as high as 1500 grams.  The reason for the low consumption rate is the high cost of honey in Brazilian supermarkets.  In a typical Parana supermarket, a liter of honey can cost R$ 11 (US$ 6.30) and in Brasilia, it can cost as much as R$ 25 per liter (US$ 14.30).  Honey producers in Parana are paid an average of R$ 6.50 per liter (US$ 3.70) for their product.

	Honey producers in Brazil feel that the high cost of the product discourages consumption and that they need to ramp up production in order to drive down the cost in the supermarkets.  Honey consumption increases in Brazil during the cooler winter months and tails off during the hotter summer months.
