Most Row Crop Production in Southern Brazil is No-Till
<p>
	Over the last two decades, farmers in southern Brazil have converted nearly all the row crop production from conventional tillage to no-till operations.  On the steep hills of Parana for example, no-till practices have greatly reduced erosion, increased soil fertility, saving time and money while increasing productivity.

	When a farmer uses no-till practices, the crop residue is left on the surface and the farmer does not till the soil between crops or growing seasons.  Each subsequent crop is planted directly into the residue of the precious crop.  One of the main reasons for tilling the soil has been for weed control, but the use of modern day herbicides has eliminated the need to till the soil in order to kill the weeds.

Leaving the crop residue on the surface of the soil has a lot of advantages including:  it helps to conserve the soil moisture by reducing evaporation, the rainfall can more easily infiltrate into the soil, it helps to conserve nutrients and fertility, it greatly reduces erosion, and it improves the water quality of the rivers.

	By keeping the soil covered year-round, no-till farming is the number one way to reduce soil erosion.   According to Henrique Debiasi, a soil scientist with Embrapa, in the 70's and 80's before no-till was introduced into the state of Parana, a typical field in the state was losing on average 20 tons of soil per year.  After the introduction of no-till, the amount of soil erosion was reduced by 90%.  Today in the state of Parana, 90% of the farmers are using no-till.

	Before the introduction of no-till, farmers in Parana would prepare the soil at the end of the dry season using conventional tillage and the soil would be completely exposed waiting for the first rains of the summer.  The first rains can be heavy downpours which often resulted in severe erosion.  Farmers quickly realized that by using no-till they could not only reduce the erosion of their valuable topsoil, they would also save money by not having the running water remove some of their recently applied fertilizers.  Today, in the state of Parana, the fields are covered with residue when the first rains materialize.

	The use of no-till also saves time and money by not having to repeatedly go across the field preparing the soil.  Farmers can plant more acres in a timely fashion and they save on diesel fuel.  The amount of fertilizer needed is also reduced with the use of no-till.  The cost of purchasing a no-till planted can quickly be recouped by the savings in fertilizer use alone.
