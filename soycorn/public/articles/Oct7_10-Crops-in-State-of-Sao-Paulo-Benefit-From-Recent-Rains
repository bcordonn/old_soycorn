Crops in the State of Sao Paulo Benefit from Recent Rains
<p>
	In many areas of the state of Sao Paulo, the recent rains have been sufficient enough to recharge the soil moisture and allow farmers to start planting the 2010/11 summer crops.  The heaviest rains were recorded in the western part of the state where 242 mm (9.6 inches) fell in Presidente Prudente and 140 mm (5.6 inches) fell in Jaboticabal.  In these areas, the soil moisture is at 100% capacity, at least for the time being.  Most of the soil moisture across the state is at 50% to 90% capacity with a few locations still at only 10% of capacity.

	The principal row crops in the state are soybeans and corn and the farmers are anxious to start planting their soybean crop in order to allow enough time to plant a second crop of corn early next year.  Farmers are also now starting to plant their full season corn crop as well.

	Ranchers are very pleased to see that the pastures across the state have started to recover from the five to six months of dry weather.  During the extended dry season, ranchers have been forced to supplement the dry pastures with additional hay and silage.  This year was very different than last year when the pastures in the state generally stayed green throughout the dry season.  The dry season in Sao Paulo is generally never as hot and dry as it is further northwest in Mato Grosso for example.  Generally in the state of Sao Paulo, the dry season is occasionally interrupted by light and scattered showers, but that was not the case in 2010.

	Sao Paulo is also a major producer of tree crops such as coffee and oranges.  These heavier rains were needed to help the flowering of these crops.  Regular rains will now be needed to keep the trees flowering satisfactorily.

	Sao Paulo is also the largest sugarcane producing state in Brazil accounting for 60% of Brazil's total sugarcane acreage.  These rains will be a big benefit for the sugarcane that was recently harvested by encouraging a rapid re-growth of the crop.  A field of sugarcane can be harvested up to five times before it needs to be replanted.  On the flip side, the rains have temporarily slowed the sugarcane harvest and processing in the state.
