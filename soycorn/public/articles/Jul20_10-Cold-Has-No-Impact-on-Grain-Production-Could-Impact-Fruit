Cold Has No Impact on Grain Production, But Could Impact Fruit 
<p>
	Then record cold temperatures are not expected to adversely affect the winter crops in southern South America.  Wheat is the major crop that is currently growing in southern South America.  Since the wheat is in vegetative development, agronomists in Parana and Rio Grande do Sul feel the cold temperatures will have no adverse affect and could actually benefit the crop.  Farmers in Argentina also feel the cold temperatures did not harm the wheat crop at all.

	The <i>safrinha</i> corn crop is also expected to escape any potential damage from the cold temperatures.  Most of the <i>safrinha</i> corn crop in southern Brazil is grown in the state of Parana and approximately 25% of that crop has already been harvested.  The reaming <i>safrinha</i> corn is maturing and safe from any potential frost damage.  The state of Parana is expected to produce 3.06 million tons of wheat, which would be 23% more than last year's drought affected crop.  Parana is also expected to produce 5.9 million tons of <i>safrinha</i> corn, which would also be 32% more than last year.

Fruit growers in southern Brazil fear that the cold temperatures did harm some of the early varieties of peaches and plums that were starting to flower, but wine growers in Rio Grande do Sul actually feel the cold weather may have benefited the grape vines.  The states of Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul are the major fruit producing states in Brazil.

The cold temperatures are expected increase the costs for the livestock producers in southern Brazil.  The state of Santa Catarina is the largest hog producing state in Brazil and producers had to spend additional resources in heating the hog houses during the cold spell.  The cost for poultry producers are expected to be higher as well also for the same reason.
