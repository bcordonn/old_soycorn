Dry Weather Could Impact Late-Planted Soybeans In Rio Grande do Sul 
<p>
The farmers in Rio Grande do Sul have started harvesting their early-planted soybeans and the initial yield reports are promising, but many farmers are worried about their late-planted soybeans and if they might be impacted by the current stretch of dry weather than has settled into the state.  Wet weather during November pushed back the soybean planting in the state into December and those late-planted soybeans are now in the midst of filling pods.

In the area of Passo Fundo for example, which is located in the north-central part of the state, 40% of the soybeans were planted after the recommended date.  Many of the late-planted soybeans weren't planted until mid-December, which is a month later than recommended.  Those soybeans are now filling pods.  The pod filling period is when soybeans require the most water, but there has been little or no rainfall in the region for about 20 days. If rains don't return soon, yields will be significantly impacted.  Originally, yields in the area were expected to be in the range of 50 sacks per hectare (3,000 kg/ha or 43.5 bu/ac), but expectations have been lowered to a more realistic 40-42 sacks per hectare (2,400 kg/ha to 2,520 kg/ha or 34.8 bu/ac to 36.5 bu/ac).

Soybean farmers in Rio Grande do Sul struggled to get their 2009-10 soybeans planted, but once planting was complete, the weather turned favorable and the crop developed normally.  Their biggest concern was if the rainy season would extend long enough to finish the crop successfully.  In parts of the state, the soybean crop will be very good, but in the dryer regions, it may end up being a disappointing year.  During January and February, expectations were that the soybean crop in the state might set a new record yield, but currently, the soybean yield in Rio Grande do Sul is now expected to be about normal.
