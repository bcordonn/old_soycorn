Safrinha Corn Planting Ahead Of Schedule In Mato Grosso Behind Schedule In Parana
<p>
As Brazilian soybean farmers harvest their early and medium maturing soybeans, they are quickly getting back into the field to plant their <i>safrinha</i> corn and in some cases cotton.  The two main states for <i>safrinha</i> corn production are Mato Grosso and Parana.  In the case of <i>safrinha</i> cotton production, nearly all of it is planted in the state of Mato Grosso.  
</p>
<p>
In Mato Grosso, 86% of the <i>safrinha</i> corn has been planted, which is significantly ahead of the 60% that was planted last year at this time.  During the 2008-09 growing season, the soybean planting in Mato Grosso was delayed due to dry weather during September and October and thus the 2009 <i>safrinha</i> corn crop was planted late as well.   The 2009-10 soybean crop in Mato Grosso was planted very early and thus the <i>safrinha</i> corn is being planted early as well.  In Mato Grosso 60% of the <i>safrinha</i> corn is in vegetative development and 40% is germinating and establishing a stand.  
</p>
<p>
The earliest planted <i>safrinha</i> corn in Mato Grosso will start to pollinate at the end of March or early April.  The latest planted <i>safrinha</i> corn won't start to pollinate until sometime in May.  The current weather in Mato Grosso is hot and humid with frequent afternoon showers, ideal conditions for rapid vegetative development of the corn crop.
</p>
<p>
Late planted <i>safrinha</i> corn in Mato Grosso runs the risk of moisture deficits late in its development.  The rainy season normally ends sometime in May.  Between May and September is the dry season in Mato Grosso when temperatures are still warm, but rainfall is nearly nonexistent.  If the corn is planted too late, the soil moisture supply may run out before the crop has a chance to fill the grain.

<p>
The situation for the <i>safrinha</i> corn crop in Parana is a little different.  Frequent rains have slowed the early soybean harvest and as a result, the <i>safrinha</i> corn is being planted at a slower pace compared to 2009.  Currently, 40% of the <i>safrinha</i> corn has been planted in Parana compared to 55% last year at this time.  In Parana, 60% of the planted crop is germinating and establishing a stand and 40% is in vegetative development.  The current weather in Parana is hot and humid, which is very good for rapid germination and stand establishment of the corn crop.

<p>
Late planted <i>safrinha</i> corn in Parana runs the risk of being affected by cold temperatures late in its development.  If cold weather is going to occur in Parana, it usually occurs during June or early July and killing frosts are not out of the question.  Late planted <i>safrinha</i> corn can be in the midst of grain filling during this period and subject to damage caused by the cold temperatures.
</p>
<p>
Since <i>safrinha</i> corn production is a risky proposition, farmers generally limit the amount of inputs they put into the crop and as a result, yields often times are quite low.  If the rainy season is extended and there are no cold temperatures in southern Brazil, the <i>safrinha</i> corn yields can be acceptable.
