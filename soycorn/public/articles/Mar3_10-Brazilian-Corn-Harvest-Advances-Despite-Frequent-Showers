Brazilian Corn Harvest Advances Despite Frequent Showers
<p>
Farmers in Brazil have been moderately successful in harvesting their early maturing corn in between rain showers.  Full-season corn acreage was reduced significantly in 2009-10, so there are fewer acres to harvest compared to last year.  Most farmers are reporting average to slightly below average corn yields.

<p>
<b>Parana</b> - The state of Parana is the number one corn producing state in Brazil and the farmers in the state are having a difficult time getting their corn harvested due to the frequent rains.  Farmers in the state reduced their full-season corn acreage by 27% and yet they have only managed to harvest approximately 25% of the crop.  Corn yields in the state are reported to be average or slightly below average.  In areas where the rainfall was the heaviest, some farmers are reporting yields as much as 8% below average.  Approximately 60% of the corn in Parana is maturing and 35% is still in the grain-filling phase.

<b>Rio Grande do Sul</b> - Even though rains have slowed the corn harvest progress in Rio Grande do Sul, farmers in the state have managed to harvest approximately 40% of their corn crop.  Yields are reported to be about average and the recent rainfall should insure good grain filling for the 35% of the crop that has not yet started to mature.

<p>
<b>Goias</b> - In the state of Goias, the rainfall has been even more problematic Farmers in Goias have harvested 36% of their corn, which is just 3% more than last week.  Most of the reported yields are about average, but some farmers are reporting yields as much as 4% below average.  In Goias 58% of the corn is maturing while 37% is still filling grain.

<b>Mato Grosso and Mato Grosso do Sul</b> - Farmers in Mato Grosso have managed to harvest 45% of their corn, but in Mato Grosso do Sul, only 30% of the corn has been harvested.  In both states the corn has an extra high moisture content requiring additional drying before storage.  Yields in both states are reported to be about average.
</p>
<p>
<b>Sao Palo and Minas Gerais</b> - In Sao Paulo, 26% of the corn has been harvested and in Minas Gerais, 10% has been harvested.  Early yield results in both states indicate about average type of corn yields.
