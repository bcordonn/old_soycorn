Safrinha Corn Acreage in Mato Grosso Could Decline 
<p>
	The delayed soybean planting in Mato Grosso could result in lower <i>safrinha</i> corn acreage in the state.  Generally speaking, if soybeans are planted during the month of November, there is not enough time to plant a second crop of corn after the soybean harvest without risking significant yield losses in the corn.  The state of Mato Grosso planted 1.94 million hectares of <i>safrinha</i> corn last year which was the largest <i>safrinha</i> corn acreage in Brazil.

	As of this past weekend, soybean planting in the state was 33% complete which is more than 20 percent behind last year's pace.  Estimates are that the <i>safrinha</i> corn acreage in the state might be down as much as 20% from prior estimates.

<p>
The two major municipalities in Mato Grosso where <i>safrinha</i> corn is planted are Lucas do Rio Verde and Sorriso.  These two municipalities are located in central Mato Grosso and they have planted approximately 36% of their soybeans whereas last year at this time, nearly 60% of the soybeans had already been planted.

	Total <i>safrinha</i> corn and cotton acres won't be known until early next year, but I think it is safe to estimate that the 2010/11 <i>safrinha</i> acreage in Mato Grosso will be below earlier expectations.
