Brazil Implementing Program Aimed At Increasing Corn Yields
<p>
After being successful in increasing soybean yields to some of the highest in the world, Brazilian scientists are now turning their attention to improving the corn yields in Brazil.  During the 2008-09 growing season, the national corn yield in Brazil was 4,144 kg/ha (63.8 bu/ac), but it varied from a low of 1,481 kg/ha (22.8 bu/ac) in northeastern Brazil to a high of 5,743 (88.7 bu/ac) in west-central Brazil.  Embrapa scientists are confident that they can significantly improve the corn yields in Brazil because they have shown it in their test plots.  During the 2008-09 growing season more than a thousand test plots averaged 11,034 kg/ha (169 bu/ac) with a low of 8,000 kg/ha (123 bu/ac) and a high of 16,000 kg/ha (246 bu/ac).

They feel the principal reasons for the current low productivity in Brazil include: low plant populations, planting outside of the optimum planting window, using hybrids not adopted to the region or the type of production, and low use of fertilizers.  Additional factors include controlling diseases, weeds, and pests.

Embrapa has imitated a program called Actions and Strategies to Increase Corn Productivity in Brazil where they plan on bringing together scientists, extension personnel, agronomists in both the public and private sectors to discuss the best ways to increase corn yields in Brazil.  Embrapa choose six states to participate in the program.  The states of Rio Grande do Sul and Minas Gerais were included because they both have a large corn-planted area, but low productivity.  Parana and Goias were chosen because the corn yields are high in both states, but input costs may be limiting further increases.  Mato Grosso and western Bahia where the last two states chosen because they are on the agricultural frontier where environmental concerns and sustainability are hot issues when it comes to corn production.

Large commercial-scale corn production is successful in Brazil and the yields are quite good.  The bigger challenge will be improving the corn yields of small family farmers who many times grow their corn by hand on small plots of land.  This is particularly true in northeastern Brazil where a lack of financial resources and know-how places limits on potential corn production.
