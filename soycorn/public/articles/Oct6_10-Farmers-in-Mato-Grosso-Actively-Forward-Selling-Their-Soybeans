Farmers in Mato Grosso Actively Forward Selling Their Soybeans
<p>
	Even though the rains in Brazil did not start until the last few days of September, farmers in Mato Grosso took advantage of the improved prices to forward contract a lot of the anticipated 2010/11 soybean production.  As of the end of September, 36% of the 2010/11 soybean crop in Mato Grosso had already been contracted compared to 22% last year at this time.

	According to the Mato Grosso Institute of Agricultural Economics, yesterday farmers in Sorriso, the largest soybean producing municipality in Mato Grosso, were asking R$ 37.60 per sack (approximately US$ 11.05 per bushel) and grain companies were offering R$ 35.80 per sack (approximately US$ 10.52 per bushel).
