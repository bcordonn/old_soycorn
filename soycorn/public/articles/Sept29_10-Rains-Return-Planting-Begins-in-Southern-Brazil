Rains Return - Planting Begins in Southern Brazil
<p>
	Over the weekend, summer rains returned to parts of central Brazil for the first time since April.  Heavy and widespread rains fell in Mato Grosso do Sul with only scattered rains falling in Mato Grosso and Goias (at least for the time being).  The forecast is calling for more widespread rains to fall across much of central Brazil during this week.  In southern Brazil, there were also widespread rains in Rio Grande do Sul, Parana, and Sao Paulo as well.

	As a result of the rains, soybean planting will begin this week in central Brazil, which will be two or three weeks later than it began last year.  A two or three week delay to the beginning of soybean planting in Mato Grosso by itself has no impact at all on the eventual yield of the soybeans.  In fact, the ideal time to plant full season soybeans in Mato Grosso is the first half of October.  Many farmers in Mato Grosso want to start planting as early as possible because they will plant a second crop of corn or cotton after the early soybeans are harvested.  Therefore, a slight delay for soybean planting should not affect the eventual yield of the soybeans, but it could impact the yield of the second crop of corn and when exports of new crop soybeans begin in Brazil.

Corn planting is already under way in southern Brazil with approximately 20% of the corn planted in Rio Grande do Sul and 10% of the corn planted in Parana.  It would not be a surprise if soybean planting doesn't begin later this week in Parana.
