Nearly Ideal Planting Conditions In Central Illinois
<p>
So far, spring 2010 is shaping up to be one of the best spring plantings in recent memory.  The warmer temperatures have encouraged a quick warm up of the soil and the sunny, windy, and dryer weather has allowed for a quick start to spring planting.

Last Friday and Saturday I traveled the entire length of Illinois from far northern Illinois to the southern tip of the state and farmers were in the fields working from one end of the state to the other.  Central Illinois is where the most field work has been accomplished with northern and southern areas only slightly behind.  On Saturday afternoon in central Illinois, virtually every tractor was in the field either working ground or planting corn.  In many areas it looked like the majority of the corn had already been planted and in a few fields the corn had already emerged.

Most of the soils were dry and there were clouds of dust behind each tractor.  This is far different than the last two years when farmers had to plant around standing water in central Illinois.  In fact, those same areas that had standing water all summer long last year are dry this year and farmers are planting right through them.

The condition of the soil looks to be very good which should encourage good seed-soil contact, good stands and high plant populations.  The way it is drying out, it might take a shower to have enough moisture to germinate some of the corn.  The conditions in central Illinois were nearly ideal and many of the farmers will go straight from corn to soybeans once they complete their corn planting.

The 6-10 day forecast is calling for below normal temperatures and above normal precipitation so the good streak of planting weather may not last past the end of this week.  Regardless, after two good weeks of planting, a shower would be more than welcomed by most farmers.
